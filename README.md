# hashtag-streamer

Streams a given hashtag into MongoDB (**/getTweets/:hashtag** [*GET*]) and shows (**/tweets** [*GET*]) them in real-time. 

Couldn't complete other requirements in the recruitment task document, partially because I couldn't register as Twitter Developer for API access. (they haven't accepted my applications, weird) and as I am a full-time software engineer, I couldn't have found enough time to complete all the tasks.

The code would be written much better, I know especially the front-end part is not as it should be, but I am sure I could have much better if I had more time.

PS: Thanks for being so understanding in post-interview process.
